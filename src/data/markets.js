    commentary: "The big move this week is oil. Brent off 11.5% and Dubai Platts off 6.2% on the reported US-Iran ceasefire framework. The smaller Platts drop is the part that matters for Pakistan: the import bill eased less than the headlines suggest. Petrol cut Rs 22 in response, the third consecutive cut. Everything else moves in the second order: KSE rallied with oil, gold and silver pushed higher on safe-haven flows even as the equity rally suggests the opposite story, and the rupee held flat because SBP is intervening to keep it flat. Watch the gold-equity divergence: somebody is wrong.",

    commentary: "All 18 indices closed green, but the leadership is telling. Consumer (ACI +1.96%) and Islamic funds (MII-30 +1.81%, MZNPI +1.73%) led; banks (BKTI +0.50%) and oil and gas (OGTI +0.12%) lagged. Consumer outperforming makes sense if cheaper fuel is feeding through to margins. Banks lagging despite a tight SBP rate suggests the market is pricing the budget risk (windfall taxes, sector exposure to government securities). KSE-100 is now within 1% of an all-time high. The 175,000 level is the technical zone where the broader rally either confirms with volume or rolls over into profit-taking.",

    commentary: "Brent at $92 is $17 below the $109 peak three weeks ago. The fear premium has bled out of crude. But Dubai Platts at $103.15 is what Pakistan actually pays, and the $11 gap to Brent means the import bill has eased less than the headline crash suggests. Gold and silver moving up while equities rally is unusual: typically they trade inversely. The signal is that institutional money is hedging the rally, not buying into it. Natural gas easing is consistent with the broader energy de-escalation. Dubai Platts is sourced manually pending a reliable free feed.",

    commentary: "Asia rallied with the ceasefire trade: Nikkei, Hang Seng and Sensex all firmed on softer oil. China is the exception: Shanghai is the slowest mover, consistent with the manufacturing PMI stalling at 50.0 in May. Europe is at multi-year highs across FTSE, DAX, and the broad Stoxx 600 as Bund yields stabilise. The dollar is weakening (EUR/USD at 1.1642, GBP/USD at 1.3520), which is the standard pattern when oil falls because the petrodollar bid eases. For Pakistan, the weaker dollar is a marginal positive on rupee terms, but it is dwarfed by the fact SBP is managing USD/PKR flat at 278.55.",
